Abstract#==#Pain and anesthesia information are crucial elements to identifying
surgery-related processes and outcomes. However pain is not consistently
recorded in the electronic medical record. Even when recorded, the rich complex
granularity of the pain experience may be lost. Similarly, anesthesia
information is recorded using local electronic collection systems; though the
accuracy and completeness of the information is unknown. We propose an
annotation schema to capture pain, pain management, and anesthesia event
information.
