Abstract#==#We present an unsupervised context-sensitive spelling correction method for
clinical free-text 
that uses word and character n-gram embeddings. Our method generates
misspelling replacement candidates and ranks them 
according to their semantic fit, by calculating a weighted cosine similarity
between the vectorized representation of a candidate
and the misspelling context. We greatly outperform two baseline off-the-shelf
spelling correction tools on a manually annotated MIMIC-III test set,
and counter the frequency bias of an optimized noisy channel model,
showing that neural embeddings can be successfully exploited to include
context-awareness in a spelling correction model.
