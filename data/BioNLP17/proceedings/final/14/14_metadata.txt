Abstract#==#Word embeddings are a crucial component in modern NLP. Pre-trained embeddings
released by different groups have been a major reason for their popularity.
However, they are trained on generic corpora, which limits their direct use for
domain specific tasks. In this paper, we propose a method to add task specific
information to pre-trained word embeddings. Such information can improve their
utility. We add information from medical coding data, as well as the first
level from the hierarchy of ICD-10 medical code set to different pre-trained
word embeddings. We adapt CBOW algorithm from the word2vec package for our
purpose. We evaluated our approach on five different pre-trained word
embeddings. Both the original word embeddings, and their modified versions (the
ones with added information) were used for automated review of medical coding.
The modified word embeddings give an improvement in f-score by 1% on the
5-fold evaluation on a private medical claims dataset. Our results show that
adding extra information is possible and beneficial for the task at hand.
