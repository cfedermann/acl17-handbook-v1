Abstract#==#Detecting negated concepts in clinical texts is an important part of NLP
information extraction systems. However, generalizability of negation systems
is lacking, as cross-domain experiments suffer dramatic performance losses. We
examine the performance of multiple unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms
on clinical negation detection, finding only modest gains that fall well short
of in-domain performance.
