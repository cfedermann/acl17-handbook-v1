Abstract#==#Biomedical events describe complex interactions between various biomedical
entities. Event trigger is a word or a phrase which typically signifies the
occurrence of an event. Event trigger identification is an important first step
in all event extraction methods. However many of the current approaches either
rely on complex hand-crafted features or consider features only within a
window. In this paper we propose a method that takes the advantage of recurrent
neural network (RNN) to extract higher level features present across the
sentence. Thus hidden state representation of RNN along with word and entity
type embedding as features avoid relying on the complex hand-crafted features
generated using various NLP toolkits. Our experiments have shown to achieve
state-of-art F1-score on Multi Level Event Extraction (MLEE) corpus. We have
also performed category-wise analysis of the result and discussed the
importance of various features in trigger identification task.
