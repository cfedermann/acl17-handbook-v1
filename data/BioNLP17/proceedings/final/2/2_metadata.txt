Abstract#==#This paper describes our submission to the 2017 BioASQ challenge. We
participated in Task B, Phase B which is concerned with biomedical question
answering (QA). We focus on factoid and list question, using an extractive QA
model, that is, we restrict our system to output  substrings of the provided
text snippets. At the core of our system, we use FastQA, a state-of-the-art
neural QA system. We extended it with biomedical word embeddings and changed
its answer layer to be able to answer list questions in addition to factoid
questions. We pre-trained the model on a large-scale open-domain QA dataset,
SQuAD, and then fine-tuned the parameters on the BioASQ training set. With our
approach, we achieve state-of-the-art results on factoid questions and
competitive results on list questions.
