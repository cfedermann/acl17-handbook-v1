Abstract#==#We describe a Deep Learning approach to modeling the relevance of a document's
text to a query, applied to biomedical literature. Instead of mapping each
document and query to a common semantic space, we compute a variable-length
difference vector between the query and document which is then passed through a
deep convolution stage followed by a deep regression network to produce the
estimated probability of the document's relevance to the query. Despite the
small amount of training data, this approach produces a more robust predictor
than computing similarities between semantic vector representations of the
query and document, and also results in significant improvements over
traditional IR text factors. In the future, we plan to explore its application
in improving PubMed search.
