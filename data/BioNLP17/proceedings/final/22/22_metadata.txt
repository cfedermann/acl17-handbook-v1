Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe a system for automatic construction of user disease
progression timelines from their posts in online support groups using minimal
supervision. In recent years, several online support groups have been
established which has led to a huge increase in the amount of patient-authored
text available. Creating systems which can automatically extract important
medical events and create disease progression timelines for users from such
text can help in patient health monitoring as well as studying links between
medical events and users' participation in support groups. Prior work in this
domain has used manually constructed keyword sets to detect medical events. In
this work, our aim is to perform medical event detection using minimal
supervision in order to develop a more general timeline construction system.
Our system achieves an accuracy of 55.17%, which is 92\% of the performance
achieved by a supervised baseline system.
