Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe our participation in phase B of task 5b of the fifth
edition of the annual BioASQ challenge, which includes answering factoid, list,
yes-no and summary questions from biomedical data. We describe our techniques
with an emphasis on ideal answer generation, where the goal is to produce a
relevant, precise, non-redundant, query-oriented summary from multiple relevant
documents. We make use of extractive summarization techniques to address this
task and experiment with different biomedical ontologies and various algorithms
including agglomerative clustering, Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) and
sentence compression. We propose a novel word embedding based tf-idf similarity
metric and a soft positional constraint which improve our system performance.
We evaluate our techniques on test batch 4 from the fourth edition of the
challenge. Our best system achieves a ROUGE-2 score of 0.6534 and ROUGE-SU4
score of 0.6536.
