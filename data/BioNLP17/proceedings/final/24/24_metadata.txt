Abstract#==#We investigate if writers with dementia can be automatically distinguished from
those without by analyzing linguistic markers in written text, in the form of
blog posts. We have built a corpus of several thousand blog posts, some by
people with dementia and others by people with loved ones with dementia. We use
this dataset to train and test several machine learning methods, and achieve
prediction performance at a level far above the baseline.
