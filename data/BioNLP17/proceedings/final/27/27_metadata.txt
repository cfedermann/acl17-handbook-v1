Abstract#==#Electronic medical records (EMR) have largely replaced hand-written patient
files in healthcare. The growing pool of EMR data presents a significant
resource in medical research, but the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates redacting medical records before performing
any analysis on the same. This process complicates obtaining medical data and
can remove much useful information from the record. As part of a larger project
involving ontology-driven medical processing, we employ a method of recognizing
protected health information (PHI) that maps to ontological terms. We then use
the relationships defined in the ontology to redact medical texts so that roles
and semantics of terms are retained without compromising anonymity. The method
is evaluated by clinical experts on several hundred medical documents,
achieving up to a 98.8% f-score, and has already shown promise for retaining
semantic information in later processing.
