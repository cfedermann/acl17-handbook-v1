Abstract#==#Dictated medical reports very often feature
a preamble containing metainformation
about the report such as patient and
physician names, location and name of the
clinic, date of procedure, and so on. In the
medical transcription process, the preamble
is usually omitted from the final report,
as it contains information already available
in the electronic medical record. We
present a method which is able to automatically
identify preambles in medical dictations.
The method makes use of stateof-
the-art NLP techniques including word
embeddings and Bi-LSTMs and achieves
preamble detection performance superior
to humans.
