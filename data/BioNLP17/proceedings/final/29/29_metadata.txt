Abstract#==#Many tasks in the biomedical domain require the assignment of one or more
predefined labels to input text, where the labels are a part of a hierarchical
structure (such as a taxonomy). The conventional approach is to use a
one-vs.-rest (OVR) classification setup, where a binary classifier is trained
for each label in the taxonomy or ontology where all instances not belonging to
the class are considered negative examples. The main drawbacks to this approach
are that dependencies between classes are not leveraged in the training and
classification process, and the additional computational cost of training
parallel classifiers. In this paper, we apply a new method for hierarchical
multi-label text classification that initializes a neural network model final
hidden layer such that it leverages label co-occurrence relations such as
hypernymy. This approach elegantly lends itself to hierarchical classification.
We evaluated this approach using two hierarchical multi-label text
classification tasks in the biomedical domain using both sentence- and
document-level classification. Our evaluation shows promising results for this
approach.
