Abstract#==#We propose a novel, Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) based approach to
identifying molecular events/interactions in biomedical text. Our key
contributions are: (1) an empirical validation of our hypothesis that an event
is a subgraph of the AMR graph, (2) a neural network-based model that
identifies such an event subgraph given an AMR, and (3) a distant supervision
based approach to gather additional training data. We evaluate our approach on
the 2013 Genia Event Extraction dataset and show promising results.
