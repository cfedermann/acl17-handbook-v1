Abstract#==#Assigning a standard ICD-9-CM code to disease symptoms in medical texts is an
important task in the medical domain. Automating this process could greatly
reduce the costs. However, the effectiveness of an automatic ICD-9-CM code
classifier faces a serious problem, which can be triggered by unbalanced
training data. Frequent diseases often have more training data, which helps its
classification to perform better than that of an infrequent disease. However, a
diseaseâ€™s frequency does not necessarily reflect its importance. To resolve
this training data shortage problem, we propose to strategically draw data from
PubMed to enrich the training data when there is such need. We validate our
method on the CMC dataset, and the evaluation results indicate that our method
can significantly improve the code assignment classifiers' performance at the
macro-averaging level.
