Abstract#==#Approximately 80% to 95% of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
eventually develop speech impairments, such as defective articulation, slow
laborious speech and hypernasality. The relationship between impaired speech
and asymptomatic speech may be seen as a divergence from a baseline. This
relationship can be characterized in terms of measurable combinations of
phonological characteristics that are indicative of the degree to which the two
diverge. We demonstrate that divergence measurements based on phonological
characteristics of speech correlate with physiological assessments of ALS.
Speech-based assessments offer benefits over commonly-used physiological
assessments in that they are inexpensive, non-intrusive, and do not require
trained clinical personnel for administering and interpreting the results.
