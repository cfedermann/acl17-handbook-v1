Abstract#==#Literature in Molecular Biology is abundant with linguistic metaphors. There
have been works in the past that attempt to draw parallels between linguistics
and biology, driven by the fundamental premise that proteins have a language of
their own. Since word detection is crucial to the decipherment of any  unknown
language, we attempt to establish a problem mapping from natural language text
to protein sequences at the level of words. Towards this end, we explore the
use of an unsupervised text segmentation algorithm to the task of extracting
"biological words" from protein sequences. In particular, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of using domain knowledge to complement data driven approaches in
the text segmentation task, as well as in its biological counterpart. We also
propose a novel extrinsic evaluation measure for protein words through protein
family classification.
