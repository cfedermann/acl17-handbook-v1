Abstract#==#In clinical dictation, speakers try to be as concise as possible to save time,
often resulting in utterances without explicit punctuation commands.  Since the
end product of a dictated report, e.g. an out-patient letter, does require
correct orthography, including exact punctuation, the latter need to be
restored, preferably by automated means.  This paper describes a method for
punctuation restoration based on a state-of-the-art stack of NLP and machine
learning techniques including B-RNNs with an attention mechanism and late
fusion, as well as a feature extraction technique tailored to the processing of
medical terminology using a novel vocabulary reduction model.  To the best of
our knowledge, the resulting performance is superior to that reported in prior
art on similar tasks.
