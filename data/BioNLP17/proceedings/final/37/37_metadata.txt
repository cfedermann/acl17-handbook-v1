Abstract#==#In this paper, we present pilot work on characterising the
documentation of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in the United
States Veterans Administration Electronic Health Record.  The Veterans
Health Administration is the largest health care system in the United States
with 1,233 health care facilities nationwide, serving 8.9 million
veterans per year.   We identified a random sample of 2000 Veterans
Administration patients, coded as current tobacco users, from 2008 to
2014.                       Using simple keyword matching techniques combined with
qualitative analysis, we investigated the prevalence and distribution of
e-cigarette terms in these clinical notes, discovering that for
current smokers, 11.9\% of  patient records contain an e-cigarette related
term.
