Abstract#==#Diagnosis autocoding services and research intend to both improve the
productivity of clinical coders and the accuracy of the coding. It is an
important step in data analysis for funding and reimbursement, as well as
health services planning and resource allocation. We investigate the
applicability of deep learning at autocoding of radiology reports using
International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Deep learning methods are known
to require large training data. Our goal is to explore how to use these methods
when the training data is sparse, skewed and relatively small, and how their
effectiveness compares to conventional methods. We identify optimal parameters
that could be used in setting up a convolutional neural network for autocoding
with comparable results to that of conventional methods.
