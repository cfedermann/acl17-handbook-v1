Abstract#==#Linking spans of natural language text to concepts in a structured source is an
important task for many problems. It allows intelligent systems to leverage
rich knowledge available in those sources (such as concept properties and
relations) to enhance the semantics of the mentions of these concepts in text.
In the medical domain, it is common to link text spans to medical concepts in
large, curated knowledge repositories such as the Unified Medical Language
System.
Different approaches have different strengths: some are precision-oriented,
some recall-oriented; some better at considering context but more prone to
hallucination. The variety of techniques suggests that ensembling could
outperform component technologies at this task.
In this paper, we describe our process for building a Stacking ensemble using
additional, auxiliary features for Entity Linking in the medical domain. We
report experiments that show that naive ensembling does not always outperform
component Entity Linking systems, that stacking usually outperforms naive
ensembling, and that auxiliary features added to the stacker further improve
its performance on three distinct datasets. Our best model produces
state-of-the-art results on several medical datasets.
