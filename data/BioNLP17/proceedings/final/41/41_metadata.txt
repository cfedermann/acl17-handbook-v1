Abstract#==#The goal of active learning is to minimise the cost of producing an annotated
dataset, in which annotators are assumed to be perfect, i.e., they always
choose the correct labels. However, in practice, annotators are not infallible,
and they are likely to assign incorrect labels to some instances. Proactive
learning is a generalisation of active learning that can model different kinds
of annotators. Although proactive learning has been applied to certain
labelling tasks, such as text classification, there is little work on its
application to named entity (NE) tagging. In this paper, we propose a proactive
learning method for producing NE annotated corpora, using two annotators with
different levels of expertise, and who charge different amounts based on their
levels of experience. To optimise both cost and annotation quality, we also
propose a mechanism to present multiple sentences to annotators at each
iteration. Experimental results for several corpora show that our method
facilitates the construction of high-quality NE labelled datasets at minimal
cost.
