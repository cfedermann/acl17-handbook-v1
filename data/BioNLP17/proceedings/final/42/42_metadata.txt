Abstract#==#Question answering (QA) can support physicians and biomedical researchers to
find answers to their questions in the scientific literature. Such systems
process large collections of documents in real time and include many natural
language processing (NLP) procedures. We recently developed Olelo, a QA system
for biomedicine which includes various NLP components,
such as question processing, document and passage retrieval, answer processing
and multi-document summarization. In this work, we present an evaluation of our
system on the the fifth BioASQ challenge. We participated with the current
state of the application and with an extension based on semantic role labeling
that we are currently investigating. In addition
to the BioASQ evaluation, we compared our system to other on-line biomedical QA
systems in terms of the response time and the quality of the answers.
