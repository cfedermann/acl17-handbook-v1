Abstract#==#Macquarie University's contribution to the BioASQ challenge (Task 5b Phase B)
focused on the use of query-based extractive summarisation techniques for the
generation of the ideal answers. Four runs were submitted, with approaches
ranging from a trivial system that selected the first $n$ snippets, to the use
of deep learning approaches under a regression framework. Our experiments and
the ROUGE results of the five test batches of BioASQ indicate surprisingly good
results for the trivial approach. Overall, most of our runs on the first three
test batches achieved the best ROUGE-SU4 results in the challenge.
