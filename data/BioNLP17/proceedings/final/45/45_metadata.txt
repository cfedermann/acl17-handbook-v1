Abstract#==#We propose a novel attention mechanism for a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN)-based Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) extraction model. CNNs have been shown
to have a great potential on DDI extraction tasks; however, attention
mechanisms, which emphasize important words in the sentence of a target-entity
pair, have not been investigated with the CNNs despite the fact that attention
mechanisms are shown to be effective for a general domain relation
classification task. We evaluated our model on the Task 9.2 of the
DDIExtraction-2013 shared task. As a result, our attention mechanism improved
the performance of our base CNN-based DDI model, and the model achieved an
F-score of 69.12%, which is competitive with the state-of-the-art models.
