Abstract#==#We introduce an end-to-end system capable of named-entity detection,
normalization and relation extraction for extracting information about bacteria
and their habitats from biomedical literature. Our system is based on deep
learning, CRF classifiers and vector space models. We train and evaluate the
system on the BioNLP 2016 Shared Task Bacteria Biotope data. The official
evaluation shows that the joint performance of our entity detection and
relation extraction models outperforms the winning team of the Shared Task by
19pp on F1-score, establishing a new top score for the task. We also achieve
state-of-the-art results in the normalization task. Our system is open source
and freely available at https://github.com/TurkuNLP/BHE.
