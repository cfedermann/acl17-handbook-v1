Abstract#==#This paper describes the participation of USTB_PRIR team in the 2017 BioASQ 5B
on question answering, including document retrieval, snippet retrieval, and
concept retrieval task. We introduce different multimodal query processing
strategies to enrich query terms and assign different weights to them.
Specifically, sequential dependence model (SDM), pseudo-relevance feedback
(PRF), fielded sequential dependence model (FSDM) and Divergence from
Randomness model (DFRM) are respectively performed on different fields of
PubMed articles, sentences extracted from relevant articles, the five
terminologies or ontologies (MeSH, GO, Jochem, Uniprot and DO) to achieve
better search performances. Preliminary results show that our systems
outperform others in the document and snippet retrieval task in the first two
batches.
