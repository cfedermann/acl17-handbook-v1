Abstract#==#Question answering, the identification of short accurate answers to users
questions,
is a longstanding challenge widely studied over the last decades in the open
domain. However, it still requires further efforts in the biomedical domain. In
this paper, we describe our participation in phase B of task 5b in the 2017
BioASQ
challenge using our biomedical question answering system. Our system, dealing
with four types of questions (i.e., yes/no, factoid, list, and summary), is
based on
(1) a dictionary-based approach for generating the exact answers of yes/no
questions, (2) UMLS metathesaurus and term frequency metric for extracting the
exact answers of factoid and list questions, and (3) the BM25 model and UMLS
concepts for retrieving the ideal answers (i.e., paragraph-sized summaries).
Preliminary
results show that our system achieves good and competitive results in both
exact and
ideal answers extraction tasks as compared with the participating systems.
