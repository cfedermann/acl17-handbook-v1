Abstract#==#In this paper, we present an analysis of feature extraction methods via
dimensionality reduction for the task of biomedical Word Sense Disambiguation
(WSD). We modify the vector representations in the 2-MRD WSD algorithm, and
evaluate four dimensionality reduction methods: Word Embeddings using
Continuous Bag of Words and Skip Gram, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We also evaluate the effects of vector size
on the performance of each of these methods. Results are evaluated on five
standard evaluation datasets (Abbrev.100, Abbrev.200, Abbrev.300, NLM-WSD, and
MSH-WSD). We find that vector sizes of 100 are sufficient for all techniques
except SVD, for which a vector size of 1500 is referred. We also show that SVD
performs on par with Word Embeddings for all but one dataset.
