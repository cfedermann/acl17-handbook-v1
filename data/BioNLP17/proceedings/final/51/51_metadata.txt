Abstract#==#Comparison sentences are very commonly used by authors in biomedical literature
to report results of experiments. In such comparisons, authors typically make
observations under two different scenarios. In this paper, we present a system
to automatically identify such comparative sentences and their components i.e.
the compared entities, the scale of the comparison and the aspect on which the
entities are being compared. Our methodology is based on dependencies obtained
by applying a parser to extract a wide range of comparison structures. We
evaluated our system for its effectiveness in identifying comparisons and their
components. The system achieved a F-score of 0.87 for comparison sentence
identification and 0.77-0.81 for identifying its components.
