Abstract#==#Social media sites (e.g., Twitter) have been used for surveillance of drug
safety at the population level, but studies that focus on the effects of
medications on specific sets of individuals have had to rely on other sources
of data. Mining social media data for this in-formation would require the
ability to distinguish indications of personal medication in-take in this
media. Towards that end, this paper presents an annotated corpus that can be
used to train machine learning systems to determine whether a tweet that
mentions a medication indicates that the individual posting has taken that
medication at a specific time. To demonstrate the utility of the corpus as a
training set, we present baseline results of supervised classification.
