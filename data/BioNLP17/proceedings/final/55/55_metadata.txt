Abstract#==#We study and compare two different approaches to the task of automatic
assignment of predefined classes to clinical free-text narratives. In the first
approach this is treated as a traditional mention-level named-entity
recognition task, while the second approach treats it as a sentence-level
multi-label classification task. Performance comparison across these two
approaches is conducted in the form of sentence-level evaluation and
state-of-the-art methods for both approaches are evaluated. The experiments are
done on two data sets consisting of Finnish clinical text, manually annotated
with respect to the topics pain and acute confusion. Our results suggest that
the mention-level named-entity recognition approach outperforms sentence-level
classification overall, but the latter approach still manages to achieve the
best prediction scores on several annotation classes.
