Abstract#==#Relation extraction methods are essential for creating robust text mining tools
to help researchers find useful knowledge in the vast published literature.
Easy-to-use and generalizable methods are needed to encourage an ecosystem in
which researchers can easily use shared resources and build upon each others'
methods. We present the Kindred Python package for relation extraction. It
builds upon methods from the most successful tools in the recent BioNLP Shared
Task to predict high-quality predictions with low computational cost. It also
integrates with PubAnnotation, PubTator, and BioNLP Shared Task data in order
to allow easy development and application of relation extraction models.
