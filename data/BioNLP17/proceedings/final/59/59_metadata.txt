Abstract#==#Event detection from clinical notes has been traditionally solved with rule
based and statistical natural language processing (NLP) approaches that
require extensive domain knowledge and feature engineering. In this paper, we
have explored the feasibility of approaching this task with recurrent neural
networks, clinical word embeddings and introduced a hybrid architecture to
improve detection for entities with smaller representation in the dataset. A
comparative analysis is also done which reveals the complementary behavior of
neural networks and conditional random fields in clinical entity detection.
