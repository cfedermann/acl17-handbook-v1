Abstract#==#State-of-the-art methods for protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction are
primarily feature-based or kernel-based by leveraging lexical and syntactic
information. But how to incorporate such knowledge in the recent deep learning
methods remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a
multichannel dependency-based convolutional neural network model (McDepCNN). It
applies one channel to the embedding vector of each word in the sentence, and
another channel to the embedding vector of the head of the corresponding word.
Therefore, the model can use richer information obtained from different
channels. Experiments on two public benchmarking datasets, AIMed and BioInfer,
demonstrate that McDepCNN provides up to 6% F1-score improvement over rich
feature-based methods and single-kernel methods. In addition, McDepCNN achieves
24.4% relative improvement in F1-score over the state-of-the-art methods on
cross-corpus evaluation and 12% improvement in F1-score over kernel-based
methods on "difficult" instances. These results suggest that McDepCNN
generalizes more easily over different corpora, and is capable of capturing
long distance features in the sentences.
