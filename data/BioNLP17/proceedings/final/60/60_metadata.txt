Abstract#==#Distant supervision has been applied to automatically generate labeled data for
biomedical relation extraction. Noise exists in both positively and
negatively-labeled data and affects the performance of supervised machine
learning methods. In this paper, we propose three novel heuristics based on the
notion of proximity, trigger word and confidence of patterns to leverage
lexical and syntactic information to reduce the level of noise in the distantly
labeled data. Experiments on three different tasks, extraction of
protein-protein-interaction, miRNA-gene regulation relation and
protein-localization event, show that the proposed methods can improve the
F-score over the baseline by 6, 10 and 14 points for the three tasks,
respectively. We also show that when the models are configured to output
high-confidence results, high precisions can be obtained using the proposed
methods, making them promising for facilitating manual curation for databases.
