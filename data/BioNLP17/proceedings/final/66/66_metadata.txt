Abstract#==#We present a system for automatically detecting and classifying phonologically
anomalous productions in the speech of individuals with aphasia.
Working from transcribed discourse samples, our system identifies neologisms,
and uses a combination of string alignment and language models to produce a
lattice of plausible words that the speaker may have intended to produce.
We then score this lattice according to various features, and attempt to
determine whether the anomalous production represented a phonemic error or a
genuine neologism.
This approach has the potential to be expanded to consider other types of
paraphasic errors, and could be applied to a wide variety of screening and
therapeutic applications.
