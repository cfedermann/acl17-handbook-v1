Abstract#==#The Precision Medicine Track in BioCre-ative VI aims to bring together the
Bi-oNLP community for a novel challenge focused on mining the biomedical
litera-ture in search of mutations and protein-protein interactions (PPI). In
order to support this track with an effective train-ing dataset with limited
curator time, the track organizers carefully reviewed Pub-Med articles from two
different sources: curated public PPI databases, and the re-sults of
state-of-the-art public text mining tools. We detail here the data collection,
manual review and annotation process and describe this training corpus
charac-teristics. We also describe a corpus per-formance baseline. This
analysis will provide useful information to developers and researchers for
comparing and devel-oping innovative text mining approaches for the BioCreative
VI challenge and other Precision Medicine related applica-tions.
