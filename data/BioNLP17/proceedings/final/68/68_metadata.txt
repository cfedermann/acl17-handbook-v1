Abstract#==#The goal of the BioASQ challenge is to engage researchers into creating
cuttingedge biomedical information systems. Specifically, it aims at the
promotion of systems and methodologies that are able to deal with a plethora of
different tasks in the biomedical domain. This is achieved through the
organization of challenges. The fifth challenge consisted of three tasks:
semantic indexing, question answering and a new task on information extraction.
In total, 29 teams with more than 95 systems participated in the challenge.
Overall, as in previous years, the best systems were able to outperform the
strong baselines. This suggests that stateof- the art systems are continuously
improving, pushing the frontier of research.
