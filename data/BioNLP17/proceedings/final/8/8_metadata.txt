Abstract#==#Token sequences are often used as the input for Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) in natural language processing. However, they might not be an ideal
representation for time expressions, which are long, highly varied, and
semantically complex. We describe a method for representing time expressions
with single pseudo-tokens for CNNs. With this method, we establish a new
state-of-the-art result for a clinical temporal relation extraction task.
