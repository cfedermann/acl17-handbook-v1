Abstract#==#Severe sepsis and septic shock are conditions that affect millions of patients
and have close to 50% mortality rate. Early identification of at-risk patients
significantly improves outcomes. Electronic surveillance tools have been
developed to monitor structured Electronic Medical Records and automatically
recognize early signs of sepsis. However, many sepsis risk factors (e.g.
symptoms and signs of infection) are often captured only in free text clinical
notes. In this study, we developed a method for automatic monitoring of nursing
notes for signs and symptoms of infection. We utilized a creative approach to
automatically generate an annotated dataset. The dataset was used to create a
Machine Learning model that achieved an F1-score ranging from 79 to 96%.
