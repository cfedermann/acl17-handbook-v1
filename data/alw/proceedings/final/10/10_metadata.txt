Abstract#==#In this paper, we present our work on detecting
abusive language on Arabic social
media. We extract a list of obscene
words and hashtags using common patterns
used in offensive and rude communications.
We also classify Twitter users
according to whether they use any of these
words or not in their tweets. We expand
the list of obscene words using this classification, and we report results on a
newly created dataset of classified Arabic tweets
(obscene, offensive, and clean). We make
this dataset freely available for research, in
addition to the list of obscene words and
hashtags. We are also publicly releasing
a large corpus of classified user comments
that were deleted from a popular Arabic
news site due to violations the siteâ€™s rules
and guidelines.
