Abstract#==#In this paper, we use a new categorical form of multidimensional register
analysis to identify the main dimensions of functional linguistic variation in
a corpus of abusive language, consisting of racist and sexist Tweets. By
analysing the use of a wide variety of parts-of-speech and grammatical
constructions, as well as various features related to Twitter and
computer-mediated communication, we discover three dimensions of linguistic
variation in this corpus, which we interpret as being related to the degree of
interactive, antagonistic and attitudinal language exhibited by individual
Tweets. We then demonstrate that there is a significant functional difference
between racist and sexist Tweets, with sexists Tweets tending to be more
interactive and attitudinal than racist Tweets.
