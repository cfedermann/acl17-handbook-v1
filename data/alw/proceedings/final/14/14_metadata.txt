Abstract#==#We discuss the characteristics of constructive news comments, and present
methods to identify them. First, we define the notion of constructiveness.
Second, we annotate a corpus for constructiveness. Third, we explore whether
available argumentation corpora can be useful to identify constructiveness in
news comments. Our model trained on argumentation corpora achieves a top
accuracy of 72.59% (baseline=49.44%) on our crowd-annotated test data. Finally,
we examine the relation between constructiveness and toxicity. In our
crowd-annotated data, 21.42% of the non-constructive comments and 17.89% of the
constructive comments are toxic, suggesting that non-constructive comments are
not much more toxic than constructive comments.
