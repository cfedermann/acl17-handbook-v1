Abstract#==#A study of conversations on Twitter found that some arguments between strangers
led to favorable change in discourse and even in attitudes. The authors propose
that such exchanges can be usefully distinguished according to whether
individuals or groups take part on each side, since the opportunity for a
constructive exchange of views seems to vary accordingly.
