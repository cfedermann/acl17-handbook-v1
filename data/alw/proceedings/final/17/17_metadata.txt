Abstract#==#Although social media has made it easy for people to connect on a virtually
unlimited basis, it has also opened doors to people who misuse it to undermine,
harass, humiliate, threaten and bully others. There is a lack of adequate
resources to detect and hinder its occurrence. In this paper, we  present our
initial NLP approach to detect invective posts as a first step to eventually
detect and deter cyberbullying. We crawl data containing profanities and then
determine whether or not it contains invective. Annotations on this data are
improved iteratively by in-lab annotations and crowdsourcing. We pursue
different NLP approaches containing various typical and some newer techniques
to distinguish the use of swear words in a neutral way from those instances in
which they are used in an insulting way. We also show that this model not only
works for our data set, but also can be successfully applied to different data
sets.
