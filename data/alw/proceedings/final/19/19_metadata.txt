Abstract#==#This work is part of a new initiative to use machine learning to identify
online harassment in social media and comment streams. Online harassment goes
under-reported due to the reliance on humans to identify and report harassment,
reporting that is further slowed by requirements to fill out forms providing
context. In addition, the time for moderators to respond and apply human
judgment can take days, but response times in terms of minutes are needed in
the online context. Though some of the major social media companies have been
doing proprietary work in automating the detection of harassment, there are few
tools available for use by the public. In addition, the amount of labeled
online harassment data and availability of cross-platform online harassment
datasets is limited. We present the methodology used to create a harassment
dataset and classifier and the dataset used to help the system learn what
harassment looks like.
