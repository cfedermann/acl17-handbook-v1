Abstract#==#As the body of research on abusive language detection and analysis grows, there
is a need for critical consideration of the relationships between different
subtasks that have been grouped under this label. Based on work on hate speech,
cyberbullying, and online abuse we propose a typology that captures central
similarities and differences between subtasks and discuss the implications of
this for data annotation and feature construction. We emphasize the practical
actions that can be taken by researchers to best approach their abusive
language detection subtask of interest.
