Abstract#==#The paper introduces a deep learning-based Twitter hate-speech text
classification system. The classifier assigns each tweet to one of four
predefined categories: racism, sexism, both (racism and sexism) and
non-hate-speech. Four Convolutional Neural Network models were trained on resp.
character 4-grams, word vectors based on semantic information built using
word2vec, randomly generated word vectors, and word vectors combined with
character n-grams. The feature set was down-sized in the networks by
max-pooling, and a softmax function used to classify tweets. Tested by 10-fold
cross-validation, the model based on word2vec embeddings performed best, with
higher precision than recall, and a 78.3% F-score.
