Abstract#==#This paper focuses on a particular type of abusive language, targeting 
expressions in which typically neutral adjectives take on pejorative meaning
when used as nouns - compare 'gay people' to 'the gays'. We first collect and
analyze a corpus of hand-curated, expert-annotated pejorative nominalizations
for four target adjectives: female, gay, illegal, and poor. We then collect a
second corpus of automatically-extracted and POS-tagged, crowd-annotated
tweets. For both corpora, we find support for the hypothesis that some
adjectives, when nominalized, take on negative meaning. The targeted
constructions are non-standard yet widely-used, and part-of-speech taggers
mistag some nominal forms as adjectives. We implement a tool called NomCatcher
to correct these mistaggings, and find that the same tool is effective for
identifying new adjectives subject to transformation via nominalization into
abusive language.
