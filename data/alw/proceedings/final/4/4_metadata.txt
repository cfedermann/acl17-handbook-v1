Abstract#==#Common approaches  to text categorization essentially rely either on n-gram
counts or on word embeddings. This presents important difficulties in highly
dynamic or quickly-interacting environments, where the appearance of new words
and/or varied misspellings is the norm. A paradigmatic example of this
situation is abusive online behavior, with social networks and media platforms
struggling to effectively combat uncommon or non-blacklisted hate words. To
better deal with these issues in those fast-paced environments, we propose
using the error signal of class-based language models as input to text
classification algorithms. In particular, we train a next-character prediction
model for any given class and then exploit the error of such class-based models
to inform a neural network classifier. This way, we shift from the ‘ability
to describe’ seen documents to the ‘ability to predict’ unseen content.
Preliminary studies using out-of-vocabulary splits from abusive tweet data show
promising results, outperforming competitive text categorization strategies by
4-11%.
