Abstract#==#Experimenting with a new dataset of 1.6M user comments from a Greek news portal
and existing datasets of EnglishWikipedia comments, we show that an RNN
outperforms the previous state of the art in moderation. A deep,
classification-specific attention mechanism improves further the overall
performance of the RNN. We also compare against a CNN and a word-list baseline,
considering both fully automatic and semi-automatic moderation.
