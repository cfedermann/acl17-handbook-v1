Abstract#==#Parallel collections of documents are crucial resources for training and
evaluating
machine translation (MT) systems. Even though large collections are available
for
certain domains and language pairs, these are still scarce in the biomedical
domain. We developed a parallel corpus of clinical trials in Portuguese and
English. The documents are derived from the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry
and the corpus currently contains a total of 1188 documents. In this paper, we
describe the corpus construction and discuss the quality of the translation and
the sentence alignment that we obtained.
