Abstract#==#With the advent of informal electronic communications such as social media,
colloquial languages that were historically unwritten are being written for the
first time in heavily code-switched environments. We present a method for
inducing portions of translation lexicons through the use of expert knowledge
in these settings where there are approximately zero resources available other
than a language informant, potentially not even large amounts of monolingual
data. We investigate inducing a Moroccan Darija-English translation lexicon via
French loanwords bridging into English and find that a useful lexicon is
induced for human-assisted translation and statistical machine translation.
