Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a novel two step algorithm for sentence alignment in
monolingual corpora using Unfolding Recursive Autoencoders. First, we use
unfolding recursive auto-encoders (RAE) to learn feature vectors for phrases in
syntactical tree of the sentence. To compare two sentences we use a similarity
matrix which has dimensions proportional to the size of the two sentences.
Since the similarity matrix generated to compare two sentences has varying
dimension due to different sentence lengths, a dynamic pooling layer is used to
map it to a matrix of fixed dimension. The resulting matrix is used to
calculate the similarity scores between the two sentences. The second step of
the algorithm captures the contexts in which the sentences occur in the
document by using a dynamic programming algorithm for global alignment.
