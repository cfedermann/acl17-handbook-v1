Abstract#==#This article presents the STACCw system for the BUCC 2017 shared task on
parallel sentence extraction from comparable corpora. The original STACC
approach, based on set-theoretic operations over bags of words, had been
previously shown to be efficient and portable across domains and alignment
scenarios. Wedescribe an extension of this approach with a new weighting scheme
and show that it provides significant improvements on the datasets provided for
the shared task.
