Abstract#==#This paper describes our participation in BUCC 2017 shared task:
identifying parallel sentences in comparable corpora. Our goal is to leverage
continuous vector representations and distributional semantics with a minimal
use of external preprocessing and postprocessing tools. We report experiments
that were conducted after transmitting our results.
