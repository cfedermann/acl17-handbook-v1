Abstract#==#A Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system is always trained using large
parallel corpus to produce effective translation. Not only is the corpus
scarce, it also involves a lot of manual labor and cost. Parallel corpus can be
prepared by employing comparable corpora where a pair of corpora is in two
different languages pointing to the same domain. In the present work, we try to
build a parallel corpus for French-English language pair from a given
comparable corpus. The data and the problem set are provided as part of the
shared task organized by BUCC 2017. We have proposed a system that first
translates the sentences by heavily relying on Moses and then group the
sentences based on sentence length similarity. Finally, the one to one sentence
selection was done based on Cosine Similarity algorithm.
