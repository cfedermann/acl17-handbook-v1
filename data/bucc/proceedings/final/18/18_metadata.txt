Abstract#==#Despite numerous studies devoted to mining parallel material from bilingual
data, we have yet to see the resulting technologies wholeheartedly adopted by
professional translators and terminologists alike. I argue that this state of
affairs is mainly due to two factors: the emphasis published authors put on
models (even though data is as important), and the conspicuous lack of concern
for actual end-users.
