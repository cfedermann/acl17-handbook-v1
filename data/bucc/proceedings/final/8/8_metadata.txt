Abstract#==#Twitter has become a rich source for linguistic data. Here, a possibility of
building a trilingual Latvian-Russian-English corpus of tweets from Riga,
Latvia is investigated. Such a corpus, once constructed, might be of great use
for multiple purposes including  training machine translation models, examining
cross-lingual phenomena and studying the population of Riga. This pilot study
shows that it is feasible to build such a resource by collecting and analysing
a pilot corpus, which is made publicly available and can be used to construct a
large comparable corpus.
