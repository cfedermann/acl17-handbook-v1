Abstract#==#We introduce a modular approach for literature-based discovery consisting of a
machine reading and knowledge assembly component that together produce a graph
of influence relations (e.g., ``A promotes B'') from a collection of
publications.  A search engine is used to explore direct and indirect influence
chains. Query results are substantiated with textual evidence, ranked according
to their relevance, and presented in both a table-based view, as well as a
network graph visualization.  Our approach operates in both domain-specific
settings, where there are knowledge bases and ontologies available to guide
reading, and in multi-domain settings where such resources are absent.               
     

We
demonstrate that this deep reading and search system reduces the effort needed
to uncover ``undiscovered public knowledge'', and that with the aid of this
tool a domain expert was able to drastically reduce her model building time
from months to two days.
