Abstract#==#Scattertext is an open source tool for visualizing linguistic variation between
document categories in a language-independent way. The tool presents a
scatterplot, where each axis corresponds to the rank-frequency a term occurs in
a category of documents.  Through a tie-breaking strategy, the tool is able to
display thousands of visible term-representing points and find space to legibly
label hundreds of them.   Scattertext also lends itself to a query-based
visualization of how the use of terms with similar embeddings differs between
document categories, as well as a visualization for comparing the importance
scores of bag-of-words features to univariate metrics.
