Abstract#==#Virtual agents need to adapt their personality to the user in order to become
more empathetic. To this end, we developed Zara the Supergirl, an interactive
empathetic agent, using a modular approach. In this paper, we describe the
enhanced personality module with improved recognition from speech and text
using deep learning frameworks. From raw audio, an average F-score of 69.6 was
obtained from real-time personality assessment using a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) model. From text, we improved personality recognition results
with a CNN model on top of pre-trained word embeddings and obtained an average
F-score of 71.0. Results from our Human-Agent Interaction study confirmed our
assumption that people have different agent personality preferences. We use
insights from this study to adapt our agent to user personality.
