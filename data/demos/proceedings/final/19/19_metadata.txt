Abstract#==#Hafez is an automatic poetry generation system that integrates a Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) with a Finite State Acceptor (FSA). It generates sonnets
given arbitrary topics. Furthermore, Hafez enables users to revise and polish
generated poems by adjusting various style configurations. Experiments
demonstrate that such ``polish'' mechanisms consider the user's intention and
lead to a better poem. For evaluation, we build a web interface where users can
rate the quality of each poem from 1 to 5 stars. We also speed up the whole
system by a factor of 10, via vocabulary pruning and GPU computation, so that
adequate feedback can be collected at a fast pace. Based on such feedback, the
system learns to adjust its parameters to improve poetry quality. .
