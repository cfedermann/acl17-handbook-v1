Abstract#==#Conventional customer service chatbots are usually built upon human dialogs,
yet confronted with the problems of data scale and privacy. In this paper, we
present SuperAgent, which is a customer service chatbot leveraging large-scale
and public available e-commerce data. Distinct from existing counterparts,
SuperAgent takes advantage of data from in-page product descriptions as well as
user-generated content from e-commerce websites, which is more practical and
cost-effective to answer repetitive questions, thereby freeing up support
staffs to answer much higher value questions. We demonstrate SuperAgent as an
add-on extension to mainstream web browsers and show its usefulness to user's
online shopping experience.
