Abstract#==#Advanced attention mechanisms are an important part of successful neural
network approaches for non-factoid answer selection because they allow the
models to focus on few important segments within rather long answer texts.
Analyzing attention mechanisms is thus crucial for understanding strengths and
weaknesses of particular models. We present an extensible, highly modular
service architecture that enables to transform neural network models for
non-factoid answer selection into fully featured end-to-end question answering
systems. The primary objective of our system is to enable researchers a way to
interactively explore and compare attention-based neural networks for answer
selection. Our interactive user interface helps researchers to better
understand the capabilities of the different approaches and can aid qualitative
analyses. The source-code of our system is publicly available.
