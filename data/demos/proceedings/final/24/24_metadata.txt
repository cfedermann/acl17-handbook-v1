Abstract#==#We present an Extended Named Entity Recognition API to recognize various types
of entities and classify the entities into 200 different categories. Each
entity is classified into a hierarchy of entity categories, in which the
categories near the root are more general than the categories near the leaves
of the hierarchy. This category information can be used in various applications
such as language educational applications, online news services and
recommendation engines. We show an application of the proposed API in a
Japanese online news service for Japanese language studying users.
