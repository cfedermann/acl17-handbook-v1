Abstract#==#We present UCCAApp, an open-source, flexible web-application for syntactic and
semantic phrase-based annotation in general, and for UCCA annotation in
particular. UCCAApp supports a variety of formal properties that have proven
useful for syntactic and semantic representation, such as discontiguous
phrases, multiple parents and empty elements, making it useful to a variety of
other annotation schemes with similar formal properties. UCCAApp's user
interface is intuitive and user friendly, so as to support annotation by users
with no background in linguistics or formal representation. Indeed, a pilot
version of the application has been successfully used in the compilation of the
UCCA Wikipedia treebank by annotators with no previous linguistic training. 
The application and all accompanying resources are released as open source
under the GNU public license, and are available online along with a live demo.
