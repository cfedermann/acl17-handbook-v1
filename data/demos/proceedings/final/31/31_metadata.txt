Abstract#==#Semedico is a semantic search engine designed to support literature search in
the life sciences by integrating the semantics of the domain at all stages of
the search process - from query formulation via query processing up to the
presentation of results. Semedico excels with an ad-hoc search approach which
directly reflects relevance in terms of information density of entities and
relations among them (events) and, a truly unique feature, ranks interaction
events by certainty information reflecting the degree of factuality of the
encountered event.
