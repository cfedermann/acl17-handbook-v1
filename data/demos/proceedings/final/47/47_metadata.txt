Abstract#==#Search engines running on scientific literature have been widely used by life
scientists to find publications related to their research. However, existing
search engines in life-science domain, such as PubMed, have limitations when
applied to exploring and analyzing factual knowledge (e.g., disease-gene
associations) in massive text corpora. These limitations are mainly due to the
problems that factual information exists as an unstructured form in text, and
also keyword and MeSH term-based queries cannot effectively imply semantic
relations between entities. This demo paper presents the LifeNet system to
address the limitations in existing search engines on facilitating life
sciences research. LifeNet automatically constructs structured networks of
factual knowledge from large amounts of background documents, to support
efficient exploration of structured factual knowledge in the unstructured
literature. It also provides functionalities for finding distinctive entities
for given entity types, and generating hypothetical facts to assist
literature-based knowledge discovery (e.g., drug target prediction).
