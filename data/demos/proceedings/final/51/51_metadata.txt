Abstract#==#We present the first open-source tool for annotating morphosyntactic tense,
mood and voice for English, French and German verbal complexes. The annotation
is based on a set of language-specific rules, which are applied on dependency
trees and leverage information about lemmas, morphological properties and
POS-tags of the verbs. Our tool has an average accuracy of about 76%. The
tense, mood and voice features are useful both as features in computational
modeling and for corpus-linguistic research.
