Abstract#==#We present RobotReviewer, an open-source web-based system that uses machine
learning and NLP to semi-automate biomedical evidence synthesis, to aid the
practice of Evidence-Based Medicine. RobotReviewer processes full-text journal
articles (PDFs) describing randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It appraises
the reliability of RCTs and extracts text describing key trial characteristics
(e.g., descriptions of the population) using novel NLP methods. RobotReviewer
then automatically generates a report synthesising this information. Our goal
is for RobotReviewer to automatically extract and synthesise the full-range of
structured data needed to inform evidence-based practice.
