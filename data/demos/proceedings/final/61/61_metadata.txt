Abstract#==#Analyzing and visualizing large amounts of social media communications and
contrasting short-term conversation changes over time and geolocations is
extremely important for commercial and government applications. Earlier
approaches for large-scale text stream summarization used dynamic topic models
and trending words. Instead, we rely on text embeddings -- low-dimensional word
representations in a continuous vector space where similar words are embedded
nearby each other. 

This paper presents ESTEEM, a novel tool for visualizing and evaluating
spatiotemporal embeddings learned from streaming social media texts. Our tool
allows users to monitor and analyze query words and their closest neighbors
with an interactive interface. We used state-of-the-art techniques to learn
embeddings and developed a visualization to represent dynamically changing
relations between words in social media over time and other dimensions.
This is the first interactive visualization of streaming text representations
learned from social media texts that also allows users to contrast differences
across multiple dimensions of the data.
