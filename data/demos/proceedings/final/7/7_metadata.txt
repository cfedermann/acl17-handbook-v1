Abstract#==#We describe an open-source toolkit for neural machine translation (NMT). The
toolkit prioritizes efficiency, modularity, and extensibility with the goal of
supporting NMT research into model architectures, feature representations, and
source modalities, while maintaining competitive performance and reasonable
training requirements. The toolkit consists of modeling and translation
support, as well as detailed pedagogical documentation about the underlying
techniques.
