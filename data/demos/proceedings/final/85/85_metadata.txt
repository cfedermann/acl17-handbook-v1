Abstract#==#We present a highly-flexible UIMA-based pipeline for developing structural
kernel-based systems for relational learning from text, i.e., for generating
training and test data for ranking, classifying short text pairs or measuring
similarity between pieces of text. For example, the proposed pipeline can
represent an input question and answer sentence pairs as syntactic-semantic
structures, enriching them with relational information,  e.g., links between
question class, focus and named entities, and serializes them as training and
test files for the tree kernel-based reranking framework. The pipeline
generates a number of dependency and shallow chunk-based representations shown
to achieve competitive results in previous work. It also enables easy
evaluation of the models thanks to cross-validation facilities.
